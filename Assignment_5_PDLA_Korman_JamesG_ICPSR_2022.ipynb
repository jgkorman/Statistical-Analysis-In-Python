The pooled OLS model is the most flexible model and explained the most amount of variation in log wages relative to the other models, but it is biased in its estimates and therefore untrustworthy. The random effects model again was the happy medium between the three models estimated in that it explained more of the variation in log wages relative to the pure FE model but less than the pooled OLS model. The fixed effects model was the most restrictive model but the most plauiblse model for drawing pure direct infereneces. It explained the least amount of variation in log wages, but we can be sure that the model is unbiased, as both time and entity effects were included where as for the random effects model we put up with a little bit of bias as a result of allowing the model to be more flexible and use between group variance, but we gain more efficiency. This is evident as the standard errors are smaller for the random effects model relative to the FE model suggesting to us greater precision/efficiency. "
